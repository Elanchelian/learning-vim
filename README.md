#Learning vim
##One man's journey trying to learn the insanity that is vim.

First, read this: [Coming home to Vim](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/).  

Modifications to his setup: 
* tabs set to 2 (apparently Ruby standard).  
* No relativenumber (difficult to debug by line number).

And here we go.  


Total basics:

i: insert mode  
a: insert after cursor <--- generally more useful that i  
Esc (in my cased remapped to jj): return to normal mode  
hjkl: movement keys  
o: insert line after + insert mode  
O: insert line before + insert mode
0: start of line  
$: end of line  
w: next word  
e: end of next word
b: back one word
r: replace one character
R: replace many characters
*: go to next instance of word at cursor
